PSIO SIO-X switchboard redone in kicad.  Not 100% sure this is correct yet.  Credit to Voultar for original basic design 

U1 has to be manually rotated (for now) if you print this through JLCPCB.  Indicator dot should be in the top left.  Mod chip is not included but socket is available as in the original SIO-X.
